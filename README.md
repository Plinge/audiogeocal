Acoustic Microphone Array Geometry Calibration

Today, we are often surrounded by devices with one or more microphones, such as smartphones, 
laptops, hearing aids, and wireless microphones. If they are part of an acoustic sensor network, 
their distribution in the environment can be beneficially exploited for various speech processing 
tasks. Applications like speaker localization, speaker tracking require the knowledge of the geo-
metric configuration of the sensors. It is also benefital for severals methods of speech enhance-
ment by beamforming. Therefore, acoustic microphone geometry calibration has recently become a 
very active field of research [5].

This collection provides the code for methods described in [1-5] and some example data. The code 
is free to use as long as the corresponding paper is cited in any public use. The license is to be 
followed and redistributed with the code.
